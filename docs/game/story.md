# Echoform: World and Story Overview

## Summary

Echoform is a cozy, languageless MMO with spiritual and existential themes. The player controls a non-human entity known as an Echoform, a being constructed from memory strands and light, slowly forming in a half-lost world. The game’s story is delivered through visuals, music, environmental design, and motifs—without spoken or written language.

## Core Themes
- Reconnection: The world is still alive but fragmented—players restore connections.
- Becoming: The Echoform doesn’t start fully formed; it remembers itself into shape.
- Restoration (but not erasure): The world isn’t reborn—it is rediscovered and lived in again.
- Memory & Reflection: Strands of light represent memories, which influence how the world reshapes.

## The Echoform
- The player character is a translucent, non-human silhouette who awakens alone.
- The Echoform materializes from a fading tree at the center of a personal void island.
- Memory strands—thin glowing threads—extend from the Echoform, pulsing with movement.
- These strands represent the self forming as the world responds in subtle ways.
- Echoforms don’t talk, but can sense, observe, and cause emotional or light-based reactions.

## Visual Branding
- The world uses a dark, minimalistic visual language.
- Glowing memory strands or petals occasionally appear.
- Key visual elements:
    - A lone tree stump in an infinite mirror void
    - The Echoform as a transparent humanoid figure
    - Silhouettes, soft gradients, sparse particle effects
