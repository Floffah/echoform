# Flow Documentation Index

This section documents major backend flows. Current entries:

- [Authentication Flow](authentication.md): Registration, login, session model, WebSocket auth handshake, onboarding gating, and token lifecycle.

> Additional flows (gameplay state sync, matchmaking, etc.) can be added here as they are implemented.
